# NoQuora
A google extension that is built to stop quora from always fricking asking you to make an account. </br>
Why?</br>
  Cos if I want answers, imma get answers one way or the other.</br>
  (Also boredom)
  
<h1>Installation</h1>
This ONLY works on google right now.</br>
1)Download the .crx file from the root of this git</br>
2)Open up extensions with "chrome://extensions/" </br>
3)Drag and drop the .crx file from the Downloads folder into "chrome://extensions/"</br>
And thats it!</br>
<h2> Say no to Quora, because forcing people to make accounts is annoying</h2>
